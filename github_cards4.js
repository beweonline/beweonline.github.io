<p class="flow-text">
an AJAX server/client package that runs off the ESP8266 with WIFI. It allows to connect 
to the microcontroller with a smartphone and use a TNG inspired touch interface to control 
rotation and speed of up to four different servos. Useful in scenarios where conventional 
servo testers are missing or do not provide the same numeric control functionality.
Using Okuda RC facilitates finding extreme positions like start and stop points 
in the sequence of complex robot animations.
