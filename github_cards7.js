junior is an almost-no-tools-required stripped down version of senior
designed for classroom settings without a proper crafts workshop and limited teaching time.
as such it relies on prefabricated elements:
M4 screws, nuts, washers, perforated injection moulded boards, perforated metal strips, cylindrical plastic casings, lugs, skewers;
a few pliers, screwdrivers, wrenches and a battery powered driller will suffice.
the robot can be built by pupils in as little as 4 hrs.
